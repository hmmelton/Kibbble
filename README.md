# Kibbble
It's Tinder for Dogs
(Built at SF Hacks 2017)

Includes integration with [Thalmic Myo](https://www.myo.com) for hands-free swiping!

## The Problem:
Every day in the United States, nearly **_5,500_** dogs and cats are euthanized due to overcrowding in animal shelters.  Part of the problem is that dogs are not always sheltered in areas where they have a high chance of being adopted.  For instance, an animal shelter in Seattle may have many pugs, while the residents of Seattle want golden retrievers. Conversely, a shelter in Portland may have many golden retrievers, while the residents of Portland want pugs.

## The Solution:
Kibbble has a user interface very similar to Tinder's in the sense that you swipe cards left or right depending on your preference.  In this case, however, the cards are dogs that are available for adoption.  A swipe right indicates the user's interest in adopting that dog.  By collecting user preference of sex, age, and breed of dog, Kibbble can inform shelters where specific dogs are most likely to be adopted, helping the shelters more efficiently move around their dogs.
